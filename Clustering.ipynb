    "### 1. Clustering  \n",
    "#### 📖 How the Algorithm Works  \n",
    "Clustering groups data points into similar categories without predefined labels. Common methods:  \n",
    "- **K-Means**: Divides data into K clusters based on centroids.  \n",
    "- **DBSCAN**: Density-based clustering, useful for detecting noise.  \n",
    "- **Hierarchical Clustering**: Creates a tree-like structure of clusters.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### ✅ Strengths  \n",
    "- Works well for discovering hidden patterns.  \n",
    "- Scalable with large datasets (especially K-Means).  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### ❌ Weaknesses  \n",
    "- Sensitive to the choice of K (K-Means).  \n",
    "- Can struggle with overlapping clusters.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 📊 Example Dataset  \n",
    "Dataset: [Mall Customers Segmentation (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python)  \n",

    "### 2. Association Rules  \n",
    "#### 📖 How the Algorithm Works  \n",
    "Association rules identify relationships between variables in large datasets. Common method:  \n",
    "- **Apriori Algorithm**: Generates frequent itemsets and extracts rules.  \n",
    "- **FP-Growth**: More efficient for large datasets.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### ✅ Strengths  \n",
    "- Helps in market basket analysis.  \n",
    "- Easy to interpret results.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### ❌ Weaknesses  \n",
    "- Can generate too many rules (needs pruning).  \n",
    "- Performance degrades with large itemsets.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 📊 Example Dataset  \n",
    "Dataset: [Online Retail Data (UCI)](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+Retail)  \n",

    "### 3. Correlation Analysis  \n",
    "#### 📖 How the Algorithm Works  \n",
    "Correlation measures the relationship between two variables:  \n",
    "- **Pearson Correlation**: Measures linear correlation (-1 to 1).  \n",
    "- **Spearman Rank Correlation**: Measures monotonic relationships.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### ✅ Strengths  \n",
    "- Helps understand variable dependencies.  \n",
    "- Useful for feature selection in machine learning.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### ❌ Weaknesses  \n",
    "- Only captures linear relationships.  \n",
    "- Doesn’t imply causation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 📊 Example Dataset  \n",
